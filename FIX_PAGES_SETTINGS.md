# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Settings

## ⚠️ Current Issue
GitHub Pages is showing the README instead of your Next.js dashboard. This means Pages is configured incorrectly.

## ✅ Solution: Verify GitHub Pages Source

**You MUST set GitHub Pages to use "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")**

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to Repository Settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/cdtalley/LangChain_Enterprise_Dashboard/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Check the "Source" dropdown:**
   - ❌ **WRONG**: "Deploy from a branch" (shows README)
   - ✅ **CORRECT**: "GitHub Actions" (shows your dashboard)

3. **If it's set to "Deploy from a branch":**
   - Click the dropdown
   - Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **Save**

4. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - Go to Actions: https://github.com/cdtalley/LangChain_Enterprise_Dashboard/actions
   - Look for "Deploy Next.js Dashboard to GitHub Pages"
   - Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)

5. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

6. **Check Your Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://cdtalley.github.io/LangChain_Enterprise_Dashboard/
   ```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

- ✅ Dashboard loads with sidebar and navigation
- ✅ Shows "Enterprise LangChain AI Workbench" title
- ✅ Not just the README.md file

## 📝 What I Just Fixed

1. ✅ Added `.nojekyll` file (prevents Jekyll from processing)
2. ✅ Updated workflow to create `.nojekyll` in build output
3. ✅ Pushed changes to trigger new deployment

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Check Actions Tab:**
   - Is the workflow running?
   - Did it complete successfully?
   - Any error messages?

2. **Verify Settings:**
   - Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
   - Not "main branch" or "/docs folder"

3. **Wait 2-5 minutes:**
   - First deployment takes time
   - Subsequent updates are faster

4. **Try Incognito Mode:**
   - Browser cache might be showing old content

**Most Important**: Make sure Settings → Pages → Source is set to **"GitHub Actions"**!
