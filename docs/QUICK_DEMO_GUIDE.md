  - Register a model
  - Show versioning
  - Display performance metrics
- **What to Say**: "This is a complete model registry system with versioning, lifecycle management, and performance tracking - essential for production MLOps."

#### 4. **Advanced RAG** (📊 Tab 3)
- **What to Show**:
  - Upload a document (PDF/TXT)
  - Perform a query
  - Show hybrid search results
- **What to Say**: "This implements advanced RAG with hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching, with smart chunking strategies for optimal retrieval."

#### 5. **A/B Testing** (🧪 Tab 8)
- **What to Show**:
  - Create an experiment
  - Show statistical significance testing
  - Display results dashboard
- **What to say**: "A/B testing with real statistical tests—significance, sample size, traffic splitting—for model deployment decisions."

### 💡 **Key Talking Points**

#### Architecture & design
- **Architecture**: Connection pooling, health checks, error recovery, monitoring. Adapter pattern for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB.
- **Scalability**: Docker-ready, Kubernetes-compatible, async, caching.

#### Code quality
- Type hints, error handling, test coverage. Adapter/factory patterns, context managers, logging, separation of concerns.

#### Technical depth
- Multi-agent, RAG, LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning, routing. Model registry, A/B testing, experiment tracking, monitoring, deployment.
