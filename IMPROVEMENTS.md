- Each step can have an action button
- Steps can be marked as completed

### User Flow Example (A/B Testing)
1. User sees help guide (collapsed by default)
2. Clicks to expand and see steps
3. Clicks "Go to Calculator" → scrolls to calculator
4. Clicks "Create Experiment" → opens form
5. Clicks template → auto-creates experiment
6. Clicks "Start Experiment" → begins data collection
7. Clicks "Analyze Results" → shows statistical analysis
